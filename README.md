# Event-Management-API

This is a simple Event Management API built using **Spring Boot** and **JPA**. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on events such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting events.

The API provides endpoints for managing event details, including name, start and end dates, and descriptions.

## Features
- **Create** new events
- **Read** events (get a list of all events or details of a specific event)
- **Update** event details (name, start date, end date, and description)
- **Delete** events by ID

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** - for building the RESTful API
- **Spring Data JPA** - for database interaction
- **H2 Database** (or another relational database like MySQL/PostgreSQL) - for storing event data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **JDK 23+** (Java Development Kit)
